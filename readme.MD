# Design patterns exercises

As a exercise and revision, I took a Java Design Patterns course by Dmitri Nesteruk
on Udemy. You can find the full course description 
[here](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-java/).

The course allowed me to review and update things I knew by practise. If you need a 
refresher, this course might be good for you.

On the other hand, some of the exercises are designed poorly, and error descriptions
while running the exercises is not that verbose. So finishing them might take a 
trial-and-error approach. Also, most of the exercises themselves are sadly 
quite trivial.
